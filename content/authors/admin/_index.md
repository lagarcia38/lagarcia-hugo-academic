Hi! I’m Dr. Luis Antonio Garcia. I am an Assistant Professor at [The University of Utah Kahlert School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/) focusing on the security and safety of learning-enabled Cyber-physical Systems (CPS)/Internet-of-Things (IoT). I was previously a Research Assistant Professor at the [USC Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) and a Research Lead at the  [USC Information Sciences Institute](https://www.isi.edu/). I previously held a postdoctoral appointment at the [Networked & Embedded Systems Laboratory](http://nesl.ee.ucla.edu/) at the [UCLA ECE Department](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/), collaborating with [Dr. Mani Srivastava](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X2Qs7XYAAAAJ&hl=en). I have my PhD in Computer Engineering with a Cybersecurity focus from [Rutgers University](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/), where my research advisor was [Dr. Saman Zonouz](https://sites.google.com/site/samanzonouz4n6/saman-zonouz)--who is now at Georgia Tech. My dissertation was titled [“Physics for the Sake of Security, Security for the Sake of Physics”](https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/59094/). Please don’t confuse me with the other Dr. Luis Garcia from Rutgers that roamed the academic world of the 80’s.
I was previously an academic intern at the [Logical Systems Lab at Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ls.cs.cmu.edu/), where I collaborated with Dr. André Platzer in 2017. We worked on the verification of programmable logic controllers (PLCs) in the context of cyber-physical systems. I also interned as a Software Developer Intern at Siemens Corporate Research in 2015 working with Dr. Dong Wei on PLC security.
