Recent advancements in closed-loop electrical brain stimulation have enabled more intelligent autonomy for therapeutic intervention across a wide range of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. The predominant approach relies on control-theoretic approximations of the brain’s complex functional relationships with the external environment–in particular, a mapping between targeted stimulation and naturalistic responses of different regions of the brain. However, existing approaches fail to capture the environmental context of neuronal biomarkers, i.e., the network-wide spontaneous bursts of activity as a response to a human’s experience in the world. This project will develop a trusted platform, NeurIoT, which leverages a comprehensive set of Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors to capture the human experience and environmental context, i.e., a representative subset of human sensory channels, in order to estimate the state

of the human brain and provide the necessary groundwork for smarter deep brain stimulation. Some active research areas we are exploring:

* Neurosymbolic architecture synthesis for explainable inferences across various IoT sensors to model the human experience
* Secure, privacy-aware, and resource-constrained inferences
* Safety modeling of IoT-in-the-loop neuroscience
